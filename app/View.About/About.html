                <p style="text-align: justify">
                    Hello,<br>
                    We are Stav Lutzky and Shimon Hanouna, students at Ben-Gurion University of the Negev.
                    We are 3rd year student in Information Systems Engineering and we developed this movies e-commerce website as a proof of concept.
                    Node.js was use to create the server side part and Angular was used to create the client side part, Mircrosoft Azure was used to host our database.
                </p>
                <p style="text-align: justify">
                    This are the main Difficulties we faced in the maknig of this website:
                    <br>
                    1). Desiging a website can be a pain in the neck, we looked for a way to reduce the time consumed by desgining from scratch. A quick search came up with Tweeter's
                    Bootstrap, after learning the basics we manged to implement it in our website, design was easy and fast. <br>
                    2). Some client side requirements were fully understood only when we were starting to implement them, thus requiring an update in the server side and API.
                    <br>
                    3). As we learned to use Angular, we came across more complex feature we wanted to check out. It took alot of time and dedication but we learned how to create our
                    own filters, services, directories and opensource modules.
