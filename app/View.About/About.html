                <p>
                    Welcome,
                    We are  Stav Lutzky and Shimon Hanouna students at Ben-Gurion University of the Negev.
                    We are a third year student in Information Systems Engineering and as part of a project in the course "Development Environments" we developed this site.
                    We used node.js for server side the Angular to client in addition we use the Azure in order to hold data.
                    The site offers a virtual store for purchasing movies. Enjoy!

                    hope you enjoy our project.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Difficulties we faced during the construction of the project
                    We explored using bootsrap in the project and had to learn and understand how to use it on our client side.
                    The need for client-side updates and changes that require updating on both the server side and the api.
                    In addition, we had to learn to deal with the functionality we wanted to add to ourselves: new filters that we created new objects on the screen.
                </p>
